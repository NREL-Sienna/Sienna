  title: Features and Capabilities

  service_section1:
    title: "Key Features"
    service_list:
      - service: Rigorous simulation definitions
      - service: Systematic, templated approach to optimization problems
      - service: Modular and composable framework with game-changing extensibility

  service_section2:
    title: "Core Capabilities"
    service_list:
      - service: "Efficiently defines and solves new optimization problems"
      - service: "Sequentially executes multiple problems with clear definitions of how decisions made in one step affect options in subsequent steps"
      - service: "Minimizes compilation time and uses incumbent solutions from previous periods to guide the search for optimal results when modifying complex optimization problems to represent new time periods"
      - service: "Enables reproducible simulations using Sienna\\Data's rigorous data models"
      - service: "Allows for custom development to represent new ways of operating devices or entirely different decision processes"

########################## How it Works #########################
why_us:
  title: "How It Works"
  subtitle: 
  content: "Sienna\\Ops has a modular framework with seven core packages written in the Julia programming language. Use whichever combination is right for your use case. All packages are open-source, free to use, and have a command-line interface. See the Sienna Documentation Hub for each package's documentation, general installation instructions, and tutorials."
