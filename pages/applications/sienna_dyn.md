########################## How it Works #########################
### Formatting from home11, there is a subtitle option available
why_us:
  title: "How It Works"
  subtitle: 
  content: "Sienna\\Dyn has a modular framework with five core packages written in the Julia programming language. Use whichever combination is right for your use case. All packages are open-source, free to use, and have a command-line interface. See the Sienna Documentation Hub for each package's documentation, general installation instructions, and tutorials."
